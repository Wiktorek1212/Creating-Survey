# Creating-Survey
A web application for creating surveys for employees. The so-called checklist. After logging in, the administrator can operate surveys, add new surveys, delete, edit existing surveys, create notes for employees. The user can complete the survey and see all surveys sent. The application is currently working for a company that asked me to make such a web application. Pleasant and neat interface, and very easy to use.
